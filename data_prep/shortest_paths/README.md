# Incorporating network distance in SHEPHERD

Steps for computing and adding network distance (namely, shortest path length) for each patient:
1) If you are using your own KG, run `shortest_paths.py`. Alternatively, the outputs of this script are available in the data downloaded from Harvard Dataverse.
2) Run `add_spl_to_patients.py`
